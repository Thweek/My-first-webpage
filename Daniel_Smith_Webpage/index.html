    <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>My name is Daniel Smith, I‚Äôm a University of Portsmouth graduate with a degree in palaeontology; I have spent the past two years working in as an assistant in Solihull Libraries and I‚Äôm about to start my coding career with the School of Code course. I enjoy interacting with people and talking about things we‚Äôre passionate about. I also like to help people with their problems, while working at the library I enjoyed the challenge of solving different IT problems as well as seeing people happy at the end when their problem was solved. I hope with the rest of this webpage I can tell you a bit about myself and what I‚Äôm passionate about.</p>
    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>So, let‚Äôs cover the basics, I‚Äôm 23 years old and have lived in Solihull my whole life. After going through school and college I went to Portsmouth University to study Palaeontology (Yes, the Dinosaur one) and spent three brilliant years there before coming back home to Solihull. Since then I have been working at local libraries in Solihull for around two years before the covid-19 pandemic. I‚Äôve always had an interest in computers and technology mainly through gaming But also being the resident ‚Äútech guy‚Äù in my family, so when the opportunity came due to covid-19 I jumped at the chance to take part in School of Code and try to find a career in IT. </p>
    <h3>My Passion for Games</h3>
        <p>Before anything else my true passion is games and not just video-games but boardgames and tabletop games, I enjoy the challenge they provide but also how brilliant they are for socialising. As someone who is definitely more introverted and couldn‚Äôt dance to save my life if I went to a club, I enjoy nothing more than sitting round a table with some friends playing a boardgame or online chatting with people from around the country or the world while playing video-games. I have delved into way too many different aspects of gaming, I have a collection of 30+ boardgames of varying sizes, a steam library that I really should play more of and a steadily growing pile of painted Warhammer figures.</p>
    <h3>Star Wars: X-wing</h3>
    <p>My all-time favourite game is a tabletop miniatures game called Star Wars: Xwing, this game lets you control small squadrons of Star Wars ships in deadly dogfights all with lifelike miniatures and dice. It was a game started at uni with friends and we all became addicted very fast; we quickly spent more money than we probably should have as students and were soon playing tournaments at the local hobby store. Xwing has been a constant for me over the past 3-4 years, when I came home from uni and didn‚Äôt really know anybody in the area one of the first things I did was join the local Xwing club at a hobby store in Coventry, I made some great friends there that I still play with now (pre-covid disclaimer üòâ). I continued to play in tournaments, managing to even win a small one but also playing at a national tournament with over 500 players. It is a great game with an even better community that I love being a part of.</p>
